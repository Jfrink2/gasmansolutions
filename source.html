			<p class="picPara">Tired of the same old lame training. The same old seminars? The same boring sales meetings? We can provide you with a different perspective because Justin Gasman not only does the training, he works in the industry currently - the differentiating factor is RELEVANCE! The other sales training available for our industry is conducted by talented people, no doubt. The difference is the other people USED TO BE in the retail car business. How long ago did they wait on an up? When was the last time they demoed a car? When was last time they spun a deal or got one hung?</p>
